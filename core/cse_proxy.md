You must first enable virtual routing and forwarding in your account. Then you can enable the use of IBM Cloud private CSE Proxy endpoints. For more information about setting up your account to support the private connectivity option, see [Enabling VRF and service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-service-endpoints-overview).
