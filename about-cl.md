Let's explore these features.

## Collecting data for centralized storage and analysis
{: #features-1}

In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can collect telemetry data that is generated in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, on-premises, and by other cloud providers.

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} integrates with popular logging frameworks and libraries, letting you easily transfer your data to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} for centralized storage and analysis.

## Optimizing value and controlling your observability budget
{: #about-cl-tco}

Not all data is valued equally. {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} helps optimize the value of the data that you keep by using the TCO optimizer.

When you review your observability needs and budget, you can select from three tiers of log and event processing:

* {{site.data.keyword.compliance}}: Data that is retained primarily for compliance obligations can be stored and searched as necessary at a lower cost/GB.

* {{site.data.keyword.monitoring}}: Log and event data with analysis and alert value is processed at a mid-tier cost/GB. The mid-tier includes adding the definition of metrics from logs, allowing the visualization of trends and preparation for quickly handling future incidents.

* {{site.data.keyword.frequent-search}}: Select and configure most critical and highest value data to your operations for priority query results. Data in this tier is retained in hot storage.

In the TCO optimizer, you configure policies that define which data pipeline handles data after ingestion. Data prioritization before data is stored or indexed reduces monitoring costs while simultaneously improving system visibility.

For more information, see [Controlling costs](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-controlling-cost), [TCO Optimizer](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-tco-data-pipelines), and [Data Usage](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-data-usage).


## Adhering to regulations for compliance and security
{: #features-7}

Data security and compliance is an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} priority.

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} offers encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, and adheres to industry-standard security practices.

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} helps businesses meet standards, compliance requirements and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by providing features such as data anonymization and audit logs.



## Predicting abnormal behavior to promptly detect abnormal situations
{: #about-cl-anomaly}

In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can detect abnormal behavior by configuring anomaly detection alerts that use artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze incoming logs and predict their expected behavior for 24 hours.

For example, you might want to detect rising trends of errors that are related to bad API responses that cause a spike in your logs and indicate something unusual is happening. Discover when a transactionâ€™s response time exceeds its usual duration, letting you pinpoint and address performance bottlenecks. Or, detect an unexpected spike of logs in your environment due to outgoing traffic of a host that exceeds its usual levels and might indicate that a potential security breach is occurring.


## Generating metrics derived from logs to enhance observability
{: #about-cl-event2metrics}

In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can improve observability to identify performance issues, monitor system's reliability, or troubleshoot problems by using the `Event2metrics` feature.

For example, you might use a log-based metric to monitor the page load time, the duration of a process, or count the number of log entries that contain a specific error code.

As data is ingested, metric data is derived from your logs and converted into Prometheus metrics. You can use dashboards to visualize your metrics. Alerts can be configured to notify of unexpected behavior.

Using metrics that are generated from log data is a great way to look at vast amounts of data quickly when you search on different data sources.

For more information, see [Configuring collection of metrics from logs](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-configure-event2metrics).

## Restructuring data for analysis and troubleshooting
{: #about-cl-parse}

You can restructure and parse log data to aid processing and increase the value of your data by using parsing rules.

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} parsing tools help you evaluate if data is essential or redundant. Restructuring data can help you aggregate dissimilar information that teams need to quickly find to address incidents.

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} is designed to convert log data to summarize what is happening. 

For more information, see [Parsing rules](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-log_parsing_rules).

## Enriching telemetry data with context information for enhanced analysis
{: #about-cl-enrich}

In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can enrich your log data with more context. You can automatically add fields to your JSON logs based on specific matches in your log data by using a pre-defined custom data source of your own. This way, you can enhance your log data with business, operations, or security information that is not available at run time. Enhanced telemetry data is more meaningful and actionable for effective troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and performance optimization.

For more information, see [Enriching data](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-enriching-data).


## Archiving logs for long-term storage
{: #about-cl-bucket}

In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can configure a data bucket and a metrics bucket in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} for long-term storage and search of your logs and metrics. Reindexing of logs from the archive is not needed to explore and query archived data. You can use the same queries and dashboards that you use to initially monitor the data.

In the TCO optimizer, you configure policies that define which data pipeline handles data after ingestion. For data handled through the {{site.data.keyword.monitoring}} or the {{site.data.keyword.compliance}} pipelines, data is sent only to the bucket. All data that you choose to store for search across all the TCO data pipelines is stored in the data and metrics buckets.

Data is stored after enrichment policies and parsing rules are applied. The data in long-term storage includes the context information that you choose to add and any additional restructuring of log data that is applied to enhance your monitoring, analysis, and troubleshooting.

For more information, see [Configuring buckets for long-term storage and search](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-about-bucket).



## Querying data to gain insights for troubleshooting and analysis
{: #about-cl-search}

With {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can search and easily query all data that is retained by {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}.

Data is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} in a search-friendly format. When rapid-search results are needed, data can also be stored in hot storage for priority insights into the data. Query results for both hot storage and buckets can be displayed in the same dashboards and views.

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} offers multiple tools to effectively query data:

* Simple boolean search.
* Regular expressions (RegEx queries) to match patterns in your log.
* Queries based on Apache Lucene for key value querying.
* Queries based on the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} DataPrime language. Dataprime is a query syntax for describing event transformations and aggregations. You can use DataPrime to explore data, do schema on read transformations, group and aggregate fields, extract data, and much more.
* Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to select and aggregate time series data that is derived from your logs.

Prompted help is available to construct queries for complex analysis.

For more information, see [Querying data](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-query-data&interface=ui).

## Improving operational visibility to gain insights for better analysis
{: #about-cl-config}

In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can improve operational visibility by configuring dashboards to gain insights for better analysis, troubleshooting, and decision-making of your organization's environments and applications.

You can create unlimited, personalized custom dashboards catered to your specific observability needs, or take advantage of pre-built dashboards to help you analyze and visualize log data.

Dashboard insights, which are paired with {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} machine learning analytics, give SREs the ability to quickly identify the start of an incident before it becomes a significant issue.

For more information, see [Dashboards](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-about_dashboards).

Preconfigured alerts and dashboards are available as extensions for common application environments and can be tailored to your specific environment needs. For more information, see [Extensions](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-extensions).

## Notifying about issues to raise awareness and act promptly
{: #about-cl-alert}

You can configure alerts to detect and address issues before users notice them by proactively notifying you.

Sophisticated alert rules can be configured to reduce triage time. Examples include:

* Notifying when a combination of alert events happens within a defined set of criteria.

* Receiving alerts when new errors or log types are detected, or anomalous values occur on established data.

For more information, see [Alerts](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-alerts).

## Incident management control
{: #about-cl-incident}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} provides alert incident management control. This control helps manage the operation of workloads and comprehensive environments with maintenance windows that can be managed within the tool. When complex incidents occur triggering multiple alarms, users can see the situation quickly within {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}. Configured alert management within {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} can suppress unnecessary alerts to other alert management solutions.

For more information, see [Managing triggered alerts in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-incidents).

## Integrating with other applications
{: #about-cl-integrate}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} is designed to integrate with most common application and systems management tools and fits within most toolchains. Sharing data with other operational tools is built in by design:
