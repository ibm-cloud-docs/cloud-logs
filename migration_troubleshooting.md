# Troubleshooting migration from {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}
{: #migration_troubleshooting}

## Unable to find platfotm logs routed to {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}
{: #ts_mig_host}

When you configure {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} to route platform logs to the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance that has platform logs enabled in that region, you find that you can no longer find platform logs. You might hit this problem when you launch the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} UI from an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service's UI.

To find logs routed by {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} to {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}, you will need to [change your {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} query](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-ts-hostvalue).

For example, if you use Code Engine, the query when you launch to see the logs generated by a project is as follows: `_platform:'Code Engine' label.Project:'ce-project-d6'`. After you configure {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} in the region where the project is provisioned, the query returns 0 log files. You can change the query to
`serviceName:codeengine label.Project:'ce-project-d6'` to query the logs that are generated by Code Engine for that project.
