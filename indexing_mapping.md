# Understanding indexing and field mapping
{: #indexing_mapping}

To best query your logs in {{site.data.keyword.frequent-search}}, it is important to understand how {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} indexes your data after it is analyzed.
{: shortdesc}

Indexing logs lets you quickly retrieve matching by logs using:

* Free-text searches
* Regular expressions
* Field searches

It is recommended to serialize your logs as JSON to get maximum value from {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} analytics features. See [Configuring unstructured text into JSON](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-parse-rule&interface=ui) for more information about parsing unstructured logs to JSON.
{: tip}


## Data types
{: #indexing_mapping_data_types}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} supports the following data types:

Text
:   This type represents unstructured, human-readable content that is analyzed into terms before indexing.

Keyword
:   This type represents text that does not pass through the analyzer before indexing. This data type is suitable for regular expressions, aggregation, and sorting.

    The syntax to use the keyword data type in your query is: `<fieldName>.keyword`.

    {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} can not create a keyword type when a field is longer than 256 characters.
    {: important}

Numeric
:   This type is suitable for range queries and arithmetic aggregations (`avg`, `max`, `min`, `sum`).

    The syntax to use the numeric data type in your query is: `<fieldName>.numeric`.

Date
:   This type lets you filter by timestamp or plot time-series graphs. Values should be formatted as epoch milliseconds.

Geopoint
:   This type allows you to plot longitude and latitude pairs on a Grafana map.

Object
:   This type represents a hierarchy. This means that it can contain fields of any other type (including objects).



## Data type considerations
{: #type-considerations}

Consider the following when querying data:

* Explicit mapping is supported for timestamps and geopoints. Appending `_timestamp` or `_geopoint` to your field name will map it respectively as a date or geopoint. For example, a field named `duration_timestamp` is mapped as a date.

* Dynamic mapping is used for all other fields. This means that at the time of indexing, a new fieldâ€™s value determines the mapped data type.

* Arrays are valid JSON. However, there is no dedicated array data type in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}. This means that:

   * A field can contain multiple values, and all values should be of the same data type. Otherwise, a mapping exception will occur.

   * The first value in an array determines the field mapping.

   * For an array of objects, it is not possible to query each object independently.

*  Each field in the log is mapped as one of 3 data types:

   * Text, Object, Date, or Geopoint
   * Keyword
   * Numeric


## Checking the number of index fields
{: #indexing_mapping_check}


To check the number of index fields per instance and how many you have used, in the navigation bar, click the **Usage** icon ![Usage icon](icons/usage.svg "Usage") > **Mapping Stats**. You can get the daily total number of indexes used in the *Used keys today* section.

For a service instance, the daily default limit of index fields is set to 3000.
{: note}

The index counter is reset at midnight UTC.
{: note}


## What happens when you reach the number of index fields in a day
{: #indexing_mapping_limit}

When you reach the number of index fields in a day, new fields are not indexed until the counter is reset for the next day.

An exclamation mark will be displayed on the fields that have mapping exceptions and could not be indexed.

## Searching data that includes mapping exceptions
{: #indexing_mapping_search}

When you search in {{site.data.keyword.frequent-search}}, log records that include a mapping exception can be searched by using a free text query for fields that are not indexed and by using key:value pairs of fields that are indexed.

If you have a data bucket associated to the instance, you can search logs through **All Logs**. You can search by using a free text query or by using key:value pairs.

## Alerting
{: #indexing_mapping_alert}

Alerting is not affected by data mapping exceptions and will continue to be triggered as normal.
