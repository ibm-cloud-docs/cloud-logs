# Working with alerts
{: #event-notifications-about}

As an administrator of {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you might want to send notifications of events in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to other users, or human destinations, by using email, SMS, or other supported delivery channels. Additionally, you might want to send these notifications of events to other applications to build logic by using event-driven programming using webhooks, for example. This is made possible by the integration between {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

## Overview
{: #event-notifications-about-ov}

In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you configure alerts that define the triggering conditions on filtered data on which you want to be notified. In {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}, you configure the destinations where you want to be notified for an alert and the conditions that define to which destination an event is routed. You can route events to one or more destinations based on conditions that you configure. You can notify to a service destination such as a webhook or PagerDuty, or to a human destination such as email or slack.

The following image shows different destinations where an event can be routed when an alert that you configure in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} is triggered:

To send events to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, you must connect your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} by configuring an outbound integration. For more information, see [Configuring an outbound integration to connect {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} with {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-event-notifications-configure).

Events that are generated by an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service can be forwarded to an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that is available in the same account.
- In an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance, you can only configure an outbound integration between the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance and one {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance.
- {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} is available in a subset of regions where the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service is available. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} regions](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-regions-endpoints).
- You can use the same {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account for all of your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instances.
- If you have multiple {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instances in the account, consider using an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance that is closer to your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

A service to service authorization is used in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account to authorize the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service to send an event to the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service.

When an event of interest takes place in your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance, {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} communicates with a connected {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance to forward a notification to a [supported destination](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destination).


When you configure alerts in an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance, consider the following information:
- You can define different types of alerts such as standard alerts, flow alerts, and new value alerts. For information on the alert types that are supported, see [Alerts](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-alerts&interface=ui#alert-types).
- You can use the `Incidents` page to manage alerts that are triggered. For more information, see [Managing triggered alerts](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-incidents).
- Alerts are triggered through the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service. You configure the notification channels and conditions that trigger the alert in the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service.

## Configuring alerts end to end
{: #event-notifications-about-alerts-configure}

To configure alerting in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, complete the following steps:
1. In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, alerts are triggered through the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service. If you do not currently use the service and have alerts configured in your {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instances or your {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances, you must provision an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service. For more information, see [Configuring an outbound integration for {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-event-notifications-configure).

2. In IAM, define a service to service authorization between the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance and the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance. For more information, see [Creating a S2S authorization to work with the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-iam-service-auth-en).

3. Configure an outbound integration in your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance to connect it with the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance. For more information, see [Configuring the integration with the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} service](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-event-notifications-configure).

    This task creates a **source** definition in the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance, and an integration configuration in the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

4. Define your alerts in the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance. Select the outbound integration through which you want to notify when the alert is triggered. For more information, see [Configuring alerts in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-alerts-config).

5. Configure the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance to route event notifications when an alert is triggered in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to your target destinations.

    - Define 1 or more topics.

        A topic defines the alert conditions that you want to group together.

        For example, if you have multiple alert definitions in your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance that notify through the same slack channel, you can configure these alerts within the same topic.

        Another example, if you have multiple alert definitions in your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance that notify through different slack channels, you must configure as many topics as slack channels you use, and include in a topic the alerts that notify through the same slack channel.

    - Define 1 or more destinations.

        A destination defines a notification channel that you can use to notify when an alert is triggered.

        For more information on destinations, see [Supported destinations](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destination).

    - Define 1 or more subscriptions.

        A subscription links 1 topic with 1 destination.

        You must add subscriptions to define the alerts configured in a topic are the ones notified through the destination selected in the subcription configuration.

        A subscription correlates one topic with a notification channel.

        You can have multiple subscriptions with the same topic so you can alert through multiple destination channels.




## Configuring alerts in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}
{: #event-notifications-about-alerts}

When you configure an alert in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you define per alert the following information:
- The alert severity
- Labels that you can use to easily filter by alert type. You define labels as key:value pairs such as `env:prod`.
- The alert type. For more information, see [Alert types](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-alerts&interface=ui#alert-types).
- Filter conditions that define the data that is analyzed at ingestion. You can define a search query, one or more applications, one or more subsystems, and one or more log severity values.
- The condition that defines when an alert is triggered.
- The outbound integration that you want to use for notifications.
- A schedule when the alert is active.
- What notificaton content you include.

For more information on configuring alerts, see [Configuring an alert](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-alerts-config).



## Configuring alerts in {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}
{: #event-notifications-about-channels}
