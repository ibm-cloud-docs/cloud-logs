# Working with alerts
{: #event-notifications-about}

As an administrator of {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you might want to send notifications of events in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to other users, or human destinations, by using email, SMS, or other supported delivery channels. Additionally, you might want to send these notifications of events to other applications to build logic by using event-driven programming using webhooks, for example. This is made possible by the integration between {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

## Overview
{: #event-notifications-about-ov}

In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you configure alerts that define the triggering conditions on filtered data on which you want to be notified. In {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}, you configure the destinations where you want to be notified for an alert and the conditions that define to which destination an event is routed. You can route events to one or more destinations based on conditions that you configure. You can notify to a service destination such as a webhook or PagerDuty, or to a human destination such as email or slack.

The following image shows different destinations where an event can be routed when an alert that you configure in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} is triggered:
![Alerting in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](../images/alerts-ov1.svg "Alerting in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}"){: caption="Figure 1. Alerting in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}" caption-side="bottom"}

To send events to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, you must connect your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} by configuring an outbound integration. For more information, see [Configuring an outbound integration to connect {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} with {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-event-notifications-configure).

Events that are generated by an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service can be forwarded to an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that is available in the same account.
- In an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance, you can only configure an outbound integration between the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance and one {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance.
- {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} is available is a subset of regions where the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service is available. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} regions](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-regions-endpoints).
- You can use the same {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account for all of your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instances.
- If you have multiple {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instances in the account, consider using an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance that is closer to your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

A service to service authorization is used in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account to authorize the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service to send an event to the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service.

When an event of interest takes place in your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance, {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} communicates with a connected {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance to forward a notification to a [supported destination](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-supported-destinations).


## Configuring alerts end to end
{: #event-notifications-about-alerts-configure}

The following image shows the relationship of components that are required for alerting:
![Relationship of components required for alerting](../images/event-notification-resources.svg "Relationship of components required for alerting"){: caption="Figure 1. Relationship of components required for alerting" caption-side="bottom"}

To configure alerts, you must create the following resources:
- One or more alert definitions that are configured in the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.
- A service to service authorization between the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance.
- An outbound integration to the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance from the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.
- One or more topics that define the alerts that are monitored from the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance.
- One or more destinations that define the notification channels where events can be routed.
- One ore more subscriptions that define the alerts that are notified through a destination channel.

    A subscription correlates one topic with a notification channel.
    You can have multiple subscriptions with the same topic so you can alert through multiple destination channels.

For more information, see:
- [Alerting](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-alerts)
- [What is {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}?](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-about).


## Configuring alerts in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}
{: #event-notifications-about-alerts}

When you configure an alert in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you define per alert the following information:
- The alert severity
- Labels that you can use to easily filter by alert type. You define labels as key:value pairs such as `env:prod`.
- The alert type. For more information, see [Alert types](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-alerts&interface=ui#alert-types).
- Filter conditions that define the data that is analyzed at ingestion. You can define a search query, one or more applications, one or more subsystems, and one or more log severity values.
- The condition that defines when an alert is triggered.
- The outbound integration that you want to use for notifications.
- A schedule when the alert is active.
- What notificaton content you include.

For more information on configuring alerts, see [Configuring an alert](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-alerts-config).



## Configuring alerts in {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}
{: #event-notifications-about-channels}


After you enable notifications for {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you must create topics and subscriptions in {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} so that alerts can be forwarded and delivered to your selected destinations.

When you configure an alert in {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}, you define the following components:
- A topic that defines the alerts that are monitored from the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance.
- Destinations that define the notification channels where events can be routed.
- Subscriptions that define the alerts that are notified through a destination channel.

For more information, see:
- [Configuring {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-event-notifications-alerts).
- [Event Notifications relationship model](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-relation).
