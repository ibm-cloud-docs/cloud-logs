# Configuring an outbound integration to connect {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} with {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}
{: #event-notifications-configure}

To send events that are generated when an alert is triggered in an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance, you must connect your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} by configuring an outbound integration.
{: shortdesc}

## Prereqs
{: #event-notifications-configure-prereqs}

- Learn about alerts in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}. For more information, see [Alerting](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-alerts).
- Learn about {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}. For more information, see [What is {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}?](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-about).
- Before you can enable notifications for {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, be sure that you have an [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance](/catalog/services/event-notifications){: external} that is in the same account as your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance and permisions to configure resources in the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance.


## Step 1. Define a service to service authorization
{: #event-notifications-configure-step1}

A service to service authorization is used in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account to authorize the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service to send events to the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service.

You must configure a service to service authorization between the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance and the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance. For more information, see [Creating a S2S authorization to work with the IBM Cloud Event Notifications service](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-iam-service-auth-en).

## Step 2. Configuring an outbound integration
{: #event-notifications-configure-step2}

Complete the following steps to configure an outbound integration:

1. In the console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Resource list**.
2. Select your instance of {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}.
3. In the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} navigation, click the **Integrations** icon ![Integrations icon](../icons/integrations.svg) > **Outbound integrations**.
4. In the outbound integrations section, find {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} and click **Add**.
5. On the *Integrations* page, click **Add new**.
6. If an IAM authorization between {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} doesn't exist in your account, you must configure one by clicking **IAM Authorizations**. Follow the prompts to grant access between the services. For more information, see [Creating a S2S authorization to work with the IBM Cloud Event Notifications service](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-iam-service-auth-en).
7. Enter a name for the integration.
8. Select the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that you want to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.
9. Select the **Endpoint Type** as public or private. For more information, see [Service endpoints for Event Notifications](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-regions-endpoints#en-service-endpoints)
10. To confirm the connection, click **Save**.

## Next step
{: #event-notifications-configure-next}

After you enable notifications for {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, test your connection to ensure that the events that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} are being forwarded to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}.

Complete the following steps:
1. Create an alert in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}.
2. Configure {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} resources to route an event to a destination when an alert is triggered.
3. Generate logs that trigger an alert so you can verify it through the `Incidents` page.
