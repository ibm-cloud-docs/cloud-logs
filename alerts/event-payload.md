# Event payload that is sent from {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}
{: #event-payload}

Successful events that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} contain various fields that help you to identify the source and details of an event.

Events that are generated by the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service contain only metadata properties, such as names or identifiers of resources. Sensitive data, for example API keys or passwords, are not included in generated events.
{: note}

The properties that are sent to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} vary depending on the event type and subtype. For example, if a `StandardMoreThanAlertEvent:AlertTriggered` event takes place in an instance for one or more public_cert secrets, {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} sends a notification payload to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} that is similar to the following example.
