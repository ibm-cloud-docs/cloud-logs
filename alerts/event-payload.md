# Event payload that is sent from {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}
{: #event-payload}

Successful events that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} contain various fields that help you to identify the source and details of an event.

Events that are generated by the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service contain only metadata properties, such as names or identifiers of resources. Sensitive data, for example API keys or passwords, are not included in generated events.
{: note}

The properties that are sent to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} vary depending on the event type and subtype. For example, if a `StandardMoreThanAlertEvent:AlertTriggered` event takes place in an instance for one or more public_cert secrets, {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} sends a notification payload to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} that is similar to the following example.

## Data Size
{: #event-payload-2}


In an event, the following lengths apply:

| Field Name |	Maximum number of characters |
|------------|--------------------|
| data.log_example |	1000 |
| data.alert_definition.meta_labels | 400 |
| data.alert_definition.name | 100 |
| data.alert_definition.description | 100 |
| data.alert_definition.query_statement |	100|
{: caption="Data size" caption-side="bottom"}


Each field in the payload has a specific size. If any field exceeds its maximum number of characters, the payload will be truncated.

Consider the following information:
- If a string field exceeds its maximum number of characters, it will be truncated, and an ellipsis (...) will be appended to indicate that the content has been cut off.
- Meta labels will be included up to the limit.
- Meta label keys and values will count toward the limit.
- If the log_example field exceeds its maximum number of characters, it will be converted to a string containing part of the log data followed by an ellipsis (...) to indicate truncation.
- The following additional fields are added to the data to indicate when a sample or labels are truncated:

   `log_example_truncated`: This field will be added to the payload to indicate that an example log entry was truncated.

   `meta_labels_truncated`: This field will be added to indicate that metadata labels were truncated.
