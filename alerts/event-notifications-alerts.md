# Configuring {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}
{: #event-notifications-alerts}

After you enable notifications to {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} from {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, and configure alerts in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can create topics and subscriptions in {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} so that alerts can be forwarded to destinations based on subscriptions that you configure.


The following image shows the relationship of components that are required for alerting:
![Relationship of components required for alerting](../images/event-notification-resources.svg "Relationship of components required for alerting"){: caption="Figure 1. Relationship of components required for alerting" caption-side="bottom"}

To configure the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} instance to route event notifications when an alert is triggered in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to your target destinations, you must complete the following steps:


## Prereqs
{: #event-notifications-alerts-prereqs}

- Read [What is {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}?](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-about).

- Learn more about [Working with alerts in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-event-notifications-about).

## Define 1 or more topics
{: #event-notifications-alerts-topic}
{: step}

Topics are based on a publish and subscription model. The topic subscribes to event data based on conditions that you configure. The {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service handles the routing and delivering of alerts reliably to the correct destinations based on the subscriptions that you configure.
- Each topic is created under a registered source.
- Each topic can have its own set of rules, which routes the incoming payload to the respective topic.

When you configure a topic, you define the conditions that the topic monitors to see if the event meets its subscription criteria. For example, if you have multiple alert definitions in your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance that notify through the same slack channel, you can configure these alerts within the same topic.

Another example, if you have multiple alert definitions in your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance that notify through different slack channels, you must configure as many topics as slack channels you use, and include in a topic the alerts that notify through the same slack channel.

Complete the following steps to create a topic:

1. In the console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Resource list > Developer Tools**.

2. Select your instance of {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}}.

3. In the {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} navigation, selet **Topics**.

4. Click **Create**.

5. Enter a name and a description for the topic.

6. Select a source.

    A source is a resource that is configured automatically in the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance when you configure an outbound integration in your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

7. Add rules to the topic to define which events that are generated by alerts are in scope of the topic.

    Choose any of the following options to configure rules that filter the event data that the topic subscribes to:

    If you do not select any rules, a default rule is added, which means all notifications route to the topic by default. A rule must be configured so a topic does not subscribe to all event data. If you don't have this rule, subscribers can receive alerts and the associated data for every alert generated by the instance. {: note}

    - Option 1: Configure the event type, event subtype or event severity.

        You can choose an event type. To see the list of supported types, see [Event types](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-cl-events-for-en-types).

        You can choose an event subtype. To see the list of supported subtypes, see [Event subtypes](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-cl-events-for-en-subtypes).

        You can choose a severity value. To see the list of supported severities, see [Event severities](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-event-severities).

    - Option 2: You can define advanced conditions which must follow JSONpath specifications. The correctly written rule will extract the appropriate data from the incoming request payload. {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} supports the `==` operator for JSONPath evaluation.

    - Option 3: Configure the event type, event subtype or event severity, and advanced conditions.

8. Click **Create**.




## Define 1 or more destinations
{: #event-notifications-alerts-destination}
{: step}

A destination defines a notification channel that you can use to notify when an alert is triggered.

Destinations are custom protocols, which are either services or user reachable entities. For more information on supported destinations, see [Supported destinations](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-supported-destinations).

For information on how to create a destination, see [Create an {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} destination](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-destination).

## Define 1 or more subscriptions
{: #event-notifications-alerts-subscription}
{: step}

A subscription links 1 topic with 1 destination.

You must add subscriptions to define which events, that are configured in a topic, are routed to a destination.

For information on how to create a subscription, see [Create an {{site.data.keyword.en_full_notm}} subscription](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-subscription).
