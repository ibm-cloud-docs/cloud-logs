# Creating and modifying {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} buckets
{: #buckets}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} uses {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} buckets to store data. You can create and modify these buckets for your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.
{: shortdesc}

You should create a bucket with _Cross Region_ resiliency to store and access data across multiple geographical regions to ensure high availability, durability, and disaster recovery capabilities. See [Creating and modifying {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} buckets](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints#endpoints-geo).

{: #buckets_configure}

You must configure two {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} buckets for your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

Data bucket
:   The data bucket is used to store all logs that are ingested as well as any logs that are dropped from the [configured data pipelines.](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-tco-optimizer)

    For information on configuring the data bucket, see [Configuring the data bucket](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-configure-data-bucket).
