# Configuring new value alerts
{: #alerts-config-new-value}

The new value alert is triggered by the first occurrence of a new value within a time interval. All values are tested against a list that is dynamically created while the alert is active. The alert is set by a specific query that identifies a subset of logs (if needed), and is defined with a key to track for new values within the wanted interval.
