# Configuring unique count alerts
{: #alerts-config-unique-count}

As data volumes grow and the number of alerts that are generated by logs, metrics, and security systems exponentially increases, one of the most powerful indicators of alert importance is the number of elements affected by the alert. Examples can include: the number of users who encountered a 5XX error when calling an API, the number of Kafka consumer groups that returned errors, the number of CDN locations that are currently loading your site for more than 3 seconds, or the number of different passwords that a single user attempts to log in with to your cloud service console.
