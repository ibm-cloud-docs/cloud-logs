# Agent support policy
{: #agent-support-policy}

Release agent updates are planned on a quarterly basis. Support will continue to provide assistance for two releases prior to the latest release.
{: shortdesc}

For example, if agent version `1.6.x` is the most currently release, then questions related to agents `1.5.x` and `1.4.x` will be answered.

However, new functions and security fixes will only be made available as the most current release and modification level.

For example, if a security vulnerability is found in the agent, and the current agent version is `1.6.1`, the security vulnerability will be fixed and released as `1.6.2`. Even though `1.5.x` and `1.4.x` are still supported for technical questions, patches to these releases will not be made available.
