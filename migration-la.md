# Migrating {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances
{: #migration-la}

Migrating {{site.data.keyword.la_full}} instances to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} requires provisioning {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instances. A migration tool is provided to help you migrate.
{: shortdesc}



## {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} architecture
{: #migration-platform-la-ov}


You can use {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances to monitor application logs, operational logs, and platform logs in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and outside the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

- Scenario 1:  {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances that collect platform logs only:

    To monitor platform logs, you might have configured an {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance for each region where you operate and where logs are generated by enabled services and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform.

    To migrate these instances, see [Migrating instances that collect platform logs](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-migration-platform-logs).

- Scenario 2: {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances that collect application and operational logs:

    You can send logs to the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance through different methods depending on the source such as configuring the LogDNA agent or using the ingestion REST API and libraries to send application logs.

    To migrate these instances, see [Migrating instances that collect application and operational logs](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-migration-la-op).

- Scenario 3: {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances that collect all types of logs such as service, application and operational logs, and platform logs.



## Validating the new architecture
{: #migration-la-options-validate}

While you migrate and validate the new architecture, you must send logs to your {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances, same as you currently do now. You must also send logs in parallel to your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instances to replicate your current architecture in the account.

Until you have validated the new architecture and you can remove the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances from the account, you must continue managing data through the deprecated services.

## Checklist to plan for migration
{: #migration-la-checklist}

Consider these items when you are planning your migration of {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances in an account:

- [ ] Identify the regions where you operate and where {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances are provisioned.

- [ ] Identify the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances in regions where your [platform logs are configured to be collected](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs&interface=ui).

- [ ] Check your requirements for long-term storage. Do you have [archiving](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-archiving-ov) configured for each {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance? How long do you keep the data?

    In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can query all data that is stored in your configured {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket. You own and maintain the bucket and the data stored in it.
    {: note}

- [ ] Are you streaming any data to other 3rd-party tools?

    The data format of logs does not change as part of the deprecation of the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service.
    {: important}

- [ ] Are you [excluding any data at ingestion](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-exclusion_rules) to reduce costs? Would it be useful to keep these logs for search or even for compliance? The {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service offers a TCO feature to help you optimize costs based on data criticality and operational requirements. Take time to identify useful logs that you might be currently dropping due to cost constraints.

- [ ] Are you controlling data usage by configuring [index rate alerts](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-control_usage_index_rate)?

- [ ] Do you [control access](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-iam) by using access groups? Do you use trusted profiles or service IDs? [Identify the policies](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-iam#iam_accesspolicy) in the account that grant permissions to operate the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances in the account.

- [ ] What [notification channels](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-alerts#alerts_channels) do you use for alerting? Email, slack, PagerDuty, webhook, {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} (Sysdig).

- [ ] Make an inventory of the different types of sources of infrastructure and application logs that you are monitoring. What are your sources of the data? Do you collect logs from Kubernetes clusters, Red Hat OpenShift clusters, bare servers and so on?
