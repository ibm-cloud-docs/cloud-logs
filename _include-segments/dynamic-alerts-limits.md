## Dynamic alerts limits
{: #limit-dynamic alert}

A dynamic alert is an alert with a **More than usual** or **Less than usual** condition. Each dynamic alert is allocated 500 permutations with a maximum of 10,000 permutations allowed for any {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

The permutation limit means that a maximum of 20 dynamic alerts can be configured for an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

You can still create other non-dynamic alerts when you have reached the 20 dynamic alerts limit.
