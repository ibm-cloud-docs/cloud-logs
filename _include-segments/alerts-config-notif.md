## Configure the notification details
{: step}
{: #alerts-config-5}


Complete the following steps:

1. Configure **Notify every** to define how often you want to get an event once the alert is triggered. By default is set to 0 hours and 10 minutes.

2. Enable **Notify when resolved** to get an event when the event has been resolved.

    When the alert's condition is no longer triggering events, the event that is trigered initially is marked as resolved.

3. Enable **Enable phantom mode** to indicate that this alert is a phantom alert.

    A Phantom alert serves as a building block for flow alerts.

    A Phantom alert does not trigger independent event notifications.

    When you enable this option, *Notifications* section  is removed from the alert definition.

4. Add an integration.

    You must have an outbound integration defined to be able to add an integration. For more information, see [Configuring the integration with the Event Notifications service](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-event-notifications-configure).
