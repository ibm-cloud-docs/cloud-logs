## Verifying your alert
{: #alerts-config-next}
{: step}

Trigger an alert. Once an alert is triggered and processed, the system sends notifications to the designated users or teams through various channels such as email, Slack, SMS, or integrated incident management platforms. You can then go to the *Incidents* page to see information about the alerts that are triggered. For more information, see [Managing triggered alerts in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-incidents).
