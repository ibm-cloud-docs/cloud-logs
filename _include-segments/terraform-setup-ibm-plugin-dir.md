## Set up the Terraform working directory
{: #terraform-setup-ibm-plugin-dir}
{: step}
{: terraform}

Create a folder and navigate into the folder. This folder is used to store all configuration files and variable definitions that are needed to create the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

For example, in your Terraform working directory `<terraform-working-directory>/terraform`, create the directory `myproject`.

```text
mkdir myproject && cd myproject
```
{: codeblock}
