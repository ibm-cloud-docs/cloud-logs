Always use a new directory when running the migration tool. If you are making changes to the Terraform files generated by the migration tool and run the migration tool again using the same directory, your changes to the Terraform files will be overwritten. The Terraform files will also be overwritten if you update the migration tool and run the migration tool again using the same directory.
