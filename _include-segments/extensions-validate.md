After deploying, verify that the extension configuration handles data in a way that matches your {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance TCO configuration. Alerts, dashboards, and events to metrics are features available for data handled through the {{site.data.keyword.monitoring}} and the {{site.data.keyword.frequent-search}} data pipelines. After you deploy the extension, make sure the configuration meets your needs. For example, if you have [TCO policies](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-tco-optimizer) sending data to the {{site.data.keyword.monitoring}} pipeline, you will need to change the dashboard configured by this extension to use **Analyze and Alert** data instead of **{{site.data.keyword.frequent-search}}**.
