# Managing mapping exceptions
{: #query-mapping-exceptions}

In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can get a mapping exception when data that is ingested through the {{site.data.keyword.frequent-search}} data pipeline detects the same field sent by different log records with different types.
{: shortdesc}


For instance, in a log ingested from an application, you see a field with type string and in another log generated by a different application, the same field is insgested as a number or a different type. This causes a mapping exception.

## Checking the number of mapping exceptions
{: #query-mapping-exceptions-1}


To check the number of mapping exceptions, in the navigation bar, click the **Usage** icon ![Usage icon](/icons/usage.svg "Usage") > **Mapping Stats**. You can get the daily total number of mapping exceptions in the *Mapping Exceptions - Today's count* section.


## Identifying fields with mapping exceptions
{: #query-mapping-exceptions-2}

To identify the fields that caused the mapping exceptions, you can run the following query:

```text
_exists_:"coralogix.failed_reason"
```
{: codeblock}


## Fixing fields with mapping exceptions
{: #query-mapping-exceptions-3}

To fix a mapping exception, identify the field that reports a mapping exception and the applications that are sending the same field with different types. Then, try to fix the problem at source.

Log records that include a mapping exception can only be searched by using a free text query.
