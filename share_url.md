# Sharing URLs
{: #share_url}

Sharing URLs from {{site.data.keyword.logs_full}} lets you collaborate with team members and other stakeholders by providing them access to logs, traces, and visualizations. Whether itâ€™s for troubleshooting, monitoring, or reporting, sharing views by URLs lets everyone have access to the same data and insights.
{: shortdesc}

Use this feature to:

* **Enhance collaboration.** Sharing logs, traces, and queries enables better collaboration across teams. With shared views, multiple team members can monitor and analyze the data at the same time, improving response times and spreading the workload.

* **Eliminate back-and-forth.** Instead of going back and forth over email or messaging to explain a log or create a query, sharing a view allows teams to immediately access the necessary data and collaborate without confusion.

* **Promote transparency and accountability.** Shared views promote transparency, allowing all stakeholders to monitor system performance. This transparency helps increase accountability, as everyone has visibility into the data.

A shared URL can include the following elements:

* Time ranges:

   * Relative: This option lets users share a dashboard that always displays data relative to the current time. For example, selecting `Last 15 minutes` will show data from the most recent 15 minutes, dynamically adjusting based on when the link is accessed. The dashboard will continuously refresh to reflect the latest data.

   * Fixed: This option allows users to share a dashboard view locked to a specific, fixed time period (for example, 23:33:03 to 25:05:15). When the link is opened, the dashboard will display data for the exact start and end time selected at the moment of sharing, ensuring that the view remains consistent regardless of when the link is accessed. This is useful for sharing a snapshot of a particular moment in time.

      If a fixed-time shared URL containing {{site.data.keyword.frequent-search}} logs is accessed after an extended period, the log entries might have been moved to All Logs storage due to retention policies.  To ensure no data is missed, it is recommended to share these URLs with the All Logs option selected.
      {: important}

* Filters and queries:

   * {{site.data.keyword.frequent-search}} or All Logs

   * Filter panel state

   * Lucene or DataPrime queries

* UI layout:

   * Column/row settings

   * Widget and legend states

You can analyze the URL itself to understand what is being shared.

* Unsaved and private views are sent as a temporary links with an ID. For example, `id=041pSG5WuixfglBim2FOc&page=0`.

* Public views are sent as a complete permalink (`permalink=true`) with view ID (`viewId`), time range (`time`), and query syntax type (`querySyntax`). For example, `https://dashboard.au-syd.logs.cloud.ibm.com/b1b01411-be1d-41a8-a0117-c61b7bd194a8/#/query-new/logs?viewId=1924&time=from:now-15m,to:now&page=0&permalink=true`.


## Sharing views as part of shared URLs
{: #share_url_view}

The **Logs** views help organize relevant log information, creating customized snapshots of page elements that help users work more efficiently and access critical data. Here are the 3 types of views available on any **Logs** page.

* A public view is a saved view whose privacy settings have been set to public. Once public, all team members have access to the view in the shared view dropdown.

   * The shared URL of the saved public view includes filters, the query, the time range and view name.

   * The public view might contain unsaved changes. If you choose to share it, you'll be prompted to either save the changes before sharing or share the current view without saving. The shared URL of an unsaved public view includes filters, the query, the time range and the layout.

* A private view is a saved view whose privacy settings have been set to private. This view is only accessible to the user that created it. If you attempt to share a private view, the shared URL acts as an unsaved view with a same parameters and UI layout.

* An unsaved view can be shared. If a user chooses to share an unsaved view, including the full UI layout as part of the query link will keep the link temporary with an expiry of 2 weeks. The shared URL includes filters, the query, the time range and the layout.

If you copy the URL directly from the address bar, the link will be temporary, expiring in 2 weeks. However, if you use the **Share** option to share the link, the expiration period is extended to 3 months. Also, each time the URL is accessed, its expiration period is reset to 3 months from the cache. If the URL is not accessed during this time, it will expire.
