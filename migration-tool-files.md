# Files that are generated by the Migration tool
{: #migration-tool-files}

The {{site.data.keyword.logs_full}} migration tool is a command line tool that you can use to migrate your {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance configuration to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

The Migration tool generates output files that you can use to determine future actions to be taken along with Terraform files that can be used to create more instances.
{: note}

## Temporary files
{: #migration-temp-files}

By default, the Migration tool writes temporary files to the `migration-tool/` directory. You can specify a different directory if required.

Files that are related to the migration of resources in {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instances are saved in the `migration-tool/tmp/accountID/instanceID/` directory.

The following files contain information about the instances by type:

* {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instances: `migration-tool/tmp/accountID/activity-tracker-instances_summary.json`
* {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances: `migration-tool/tmp/accountID/log-analysis-instances_summary.json`
* {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instances where the platform logs flag is enabled: `migration-tool/tmp/accountID/platform-logs-instances_summary.json`


The `migration-tool/tmp/accountID/instances_map.json` file includes information about all the instances to be migrated in the account. This file includes the following variables:

`account_id`
:   The account ID.

`instanceType`
:   Either `logdnaat` or `logdna` where `logdnaat` is an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance and `logdna` is an {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance.

`instanceName`
:   The name of the instance.

`instanceID`
:   The ID of the instance.

`instance-crn`
:   The CRN of the instance.

`cl-instance-name`
:   The name of the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance that is created by the migration.

`cl-instance-crn`
:   The CRN of the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance that is created by the migration.

`cl-instanceID`
:   The ID of the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance that is created by the migration.



Files are written with details on the current resources.
