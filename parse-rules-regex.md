# Building RegEx expressions
{: #parse-rules-regex}

In {{site.data.keyword.logs_full}}, you can use parsing rules to control the structure of your data by applying RegEx expressions before the data is indexed for search.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} uses the RegEx Golang flavor.

A RegEx pattern is case-sensitive.

## Named capture groups
{: #parse-rules-regex-capture-groups}

You can use named captured groups in a RegEx expression to define new fields from existing data in the log record.
{: note}

The format of a capture group is the following:

```text
(?P<fieldName>RegularExpression)
```
{: codeblock}

Where

- `?P` represents the beginning of a capture group.
- `fieldName` must be set to the name of the field being added.
- `RegularExpression` represents the RegEx that defines the value of the new field.

    The RegEx doesnâ€™t have to match the entire log.
