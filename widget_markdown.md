# Creating a {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} Markdown widget
{: #widget_markdown}

You can create a Markdown widget that can be included in custom {{site.data.keyword.logs_full}} dashboards.
{: shortdesc}

When creating custom dashboards, you can add Markdown widgets. Markdown widgets can be used to add tables, lists, reference guides, links, code snippets, images, and more to customize, contextualize, and optimize your dashboards.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows users to format and structure plain text documents by using a simple and intuitive syntax. By adding the Markdown widget to your custom dashboards, you can easily add personalized context to your dashboards using straightforward symbols and conventions.

No prior knowledge of Markdown is required. You have the option to edit in Markdown or take advantage of the simplified WYSIWYG editor that converts your input to Markdown.

## Creating a Markdown widget
{: #create_markdown}

1. In a [custom dashboard](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-create_dashboards), click **Add Widget** ![Add Widget icon](/icons/Plus.svg "Add Widget") and drag and drop the **Markdown*** widget from your side bar.

3. Enter a description for your widget.

4. Enter your Markdown content.

   In the top section you can see the Markdown in a simplified WYSIWYG editor.

   In the bottom section you can enter Markdown coding directly.

   When you change either section the other section is updated automatically.

5. (Optional) Add text to be displayed as a tooltip to be displayed when hovering over the widget title bar.

6. Click **Save** to save your widget.
